# configs

Configuration files for my linux environment.

# Including

* bash (including profile and aliases)
* Vim
* Tmux
* Screen (as fallback)

# Issues

There are a lot of stuff I just copied from other configs (especially from https://github.com/matze/configs) where I don't know what it does.
The reason why I copy-cated is because I saw how fast and effective those people are working with it in their Linux.
My plan is to test and customize the configs and then delete the not neccessary stuff
